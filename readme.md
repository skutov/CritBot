CirtBot
====================
This is a plugin for Teamspeak 3 to act as a bot to automatically administrate the membership of ClientGroups based off the manual assignment of ServerGroups 
in order to more easily facilitate having multiple organisations running from a single server.

To Do
====================
1. Enable the program to manage multiple sets of permissions.
2. Enable the plugin to use an external file for configuration.


Terms and Conditions
====================

This plugin is open source however, anyone who wishes to take full credit for the development of the plugin
will be removed from the project. Anyone who tries to delete whole sections with being given consent, will
be removed from the project.

Before you make a commit, please contact one of the admins (Skutov, Whoiskempo or Humroben) and alert him of any chamges or additions
so that at later dates, the plugin admin/author can work on the plugin themselves without having a clue as to what
changes have been made, where to start, and what goals have been completed.

Thank you for reading, and happy coding.
